===


Installation
------------

Eve should work with both python 2 and 3[ยน](#caldav-python3).

Requirements:

- caldav[ยน](#caldav-python3) >= 0.4.0
- irc >= 12.1.2


Notes
-----

<a name="caldav-python3">ยน</a>  Be carefull with caldav and python3: there is a dependance in vobject, which
doesn't have a proper python3 port. You'll need to find a good python3 fork.
The 2015-04-29, I used [tBaxter's fork](https://github.com/tBaxter/vobject).
I also needed to install lxml by hand since pip didn't manage to install it for
me.
